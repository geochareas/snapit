# Snapit

# Description
Snapit was developed to become Social Media Platform (similar to Instagram and Snapchat). What makes it different from the others, is that Snapit uses the proximity sensor as a trigger to upload posts. 

Built using [Firebase Platform](https://firebase.google.com/).

# Requirements
Firebase Storage, Real-time Database and Authentication (Google and Facebook).

# Uploading a snap
While being on the Main Activity, stick the device on your chest and keep it there. You will feel a vibration. This means that the app is recording. If you want to stop recording, unstick the device from your chest and you will feel a vibration again. This means that recording has stopped. You will see a confirmation dialog - click 'yes' if you want to upload what you recorded or 'cancel' if you want to cancel. After clicking yes you will be redirected to the main activity, and you will notice a bar right under the navigation bar - this means that your snap is being uploaded.
